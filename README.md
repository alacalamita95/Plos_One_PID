Unveiling Complex Patterns: An Information-Theoretic Approach to High-Order Behaviors in Microarray Data
Lacalamita et al.

This is a codebase behind the analysis of the paper.
There are two different code examples regarding two different communities: one for HCC and one for ASD.
The Matlab script takes as input the initial community and creates the Synergy matrices (note that you have to compile this code with both the original matrix and the transposed matrix so that you can perform the analysis on both genes and subjects).
The R script analyzes the Synergy data in order to produce the differentially expressed genes or biologically enriched functions.
